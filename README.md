## Description
This is simle app that allows user to see other users info (name/position/contacs) and post it own info.

## For users
App is user friendly. This nice and intuitive design allow users 
for all ages feel themself comfortable, moreover app will prompt the user if his actions 
are incorrect .Important that site adaptive for every device.

## For developers
Project architecture built on the principle of distribution of responsibility. For each speific group of actions defined a structure, that pocesses them. Components of the app is reusable and adaptive. 
That makes app easily scalable. 
During development I've used convenient commits and pre-commit linter. That makes easy to understand what happens at each stage of development.
